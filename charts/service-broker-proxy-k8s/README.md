Service Manager Broker Proxy for Kubernetes

## Introduction

This helm chart bootstraps the Service Broker Proxy for Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

* `tiller` is installed and configured in the Kubernetes cluster.
* `helm` is installed and configured.
* `service-catalog` is installed and configured in the Kubernetes cluster.
* The cluster is registered in the Service Manager as a platform.

You can register the cluster in Service Manager by executing the following command:
```sh
smctl register-platform <cluster-name> kubernetes
```
**Note:** Store the returned credentials in a safe place as you will not be able to fetch them again from Service Manager.

You can get `smctl` tool from https://github.com/Peripli/service-manager-cli.

## Installation

From the root folder of this repository, execute:
```bash
helm install charts/service-broker-proxy-k8s \
  --name service-broker-proxy \
  --namespace service-broker-proxy \
  --set image.tag=<VERSION> \
  --set config.sm.url=<SM_URL> \
  --set sm.user=<USER> \
  --set sm.password=<PASSWORD>
```

**Note:** Make sure you substitute &lt;SM_URL&gt; with the Service Manager url, &lt;USER&gt; and &lt;PASSWORD&gt; with the credentials returned from cluster registration in Service Manager (see above).
Substitute \<VERSION> with the required version as listed on [Releases](https://github.com/Peripli/service-broker-proxy-k8s/releases). It is recommended to use the latest release.

To use your own images you can set `image.repository`, `image.tag` and `image.pullPolicy` to the helm install command. In case your image is pulled from a private repository, you can use
`image.pullsecret` to name a secret containing the credentials.
